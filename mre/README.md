# Reapbot (Reaper Bot reboot)

This workspace is the clean baseline for rebuilding Reaper Bot. We are fixing
the community-reported issues first, then iterating from there in small steps.

## Plan
- Build from this clean baseline.
- Address `mre/COMMUNITY_ISSUES.md` in order.
- Keep each change small and reviewable.

## Docs
- `mre/COMMUNITY_ISSUES.md`
- `mre/SOURCES.md`
- `mre/CHANGELOG.md`
